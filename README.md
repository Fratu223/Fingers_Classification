# Unsupervised Learning
Even though the images had parts of the name to indicate which class they belong to, for example '3L' for left hands that hold up 3 fingers or '4R' for right hands that hold up 4 fingers and so on, I decided to create a function that automates the process of moving images in the right folders, since the dataset only contains one train and one test folder. There were definitely easier ways to do this, but, for the challange, I decided to use unsupervised learning for this.
